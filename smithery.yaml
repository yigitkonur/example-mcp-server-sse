# smithery.yaml
#
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: Smithery Registry Limitation
# 
# This MCP server uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport via StreamableHTTP,
# which is NOT currently supported by Smithery's hosting platform.
# 
# Smithery supports:
# - STDIO transport (process-based communication)
# - Stateless HTTP transport (request/response only)
# 
# But does NOT support:
# - SSE/EventSource streaming (which this server uses)
# - WebSocket transport
# - Persistent connection transports
#
# This server demonstrates modern MCP best practices with StreamableHTTP + SSE,
# making it incompatible with Smithery's current architecture.
#
# For educational/demo purposes, a STDIO version would be needed for Smithery.
# See the MCP SDK documentation for STDIO transport examples.

# This configuration is provided for reference but will not work on Smithery
# due to the SSE transport incompatibility mentioned above.

  Educational MCP server demonstrating StreamableHTTP with SSE transport.
  Uses modern singleton server pattern with comprehensive calculator tools.
  NOTE: Not compatible with Smithery due to SSE transport usage.
